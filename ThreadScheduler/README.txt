Check the commenting in code for more details on how to solve synchronization problems, busy waiting and multilevel feedback

Note: For multilevel feedback queue scheduling, the ready_list was used instead of the complexity of creating a new queue and ordering it. Instead from all_list, thread priorities are calculated and then the ready_list is sorted.

Make grade screenshots are in folder DESIGNDOCS, and output for make grade is in grade.txt which is in src folder
